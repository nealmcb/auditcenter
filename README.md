# rla_data: Data relevant to risk-limiting audits

The data in this repository relate to risk-limiting audits.
Initially it includes data from the statewide ballot-level comparison RLAs in Colorado, starting in 2017,
as described at [The Colorado Risk\-Limiting Audit Project \(CORLA\) and related work](http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/elections/corla/)

The initial scope includes data published in Colorado's
[Audit Center](https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/auditCenter.html),
based on the data exported from the ColoradoRLA software.
That software was originally developed by [Free & Fair](https://freeandfair.us/)
under contract with the [Colorado Department of State](https://www.sos.state.co.us/).
The format of the data for 2017 is described at
[ColoradoRLA/26_export_manual.md](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/blob/master/docs/26_export_manual.md).

The format has changed somewhat over time, as generated by subsequent versions of the software,
which have been shared at [democracyworks/ColoradoRLA](https://github.com/democracyworks/ColoradoRLA) and
[cdos-rla/colorado-rla](https://github.com/cdos-rla/colorado-rla).
